<p>There comes a time when we all need our space. Boundaries need defining, and distance has to be taken into account.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more true for the alcoholic who seeks a permanent solution to their addiction. It’s true that during detoxification and rehabilitation, an addict needs people nearby while in recovery.</p>

<p>The fact about this is detoxification and rehabilitation are two very dangerous ordeals for an addict to go through, particularly by themselves. Many things can go wrong, and in the event of a medical emergency, a credentialed healthcare worker should always be near to administer aid.</p>

<p>But what about after detox is successfully achieved, and rehab embarked upon in slow, careful steps? Is that the time you rush the end zone to gleefully jump up and down with your newly sober friend, hugging and high-fiving them as if they’ve scored a major goal?</p>

<p>Well, they have. However, the contest is anything but over.
And as for you and your high-fives and celebratory behavior, as hard as this may be to fathom, you could damage more than help the game plan.</p>

<h2>
<a id="give-them-space" class="anchor" href="#give-them-space" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GIVE THEM SPACE</h2>

<p>As difficult as this might seem, what with your happiness and support for your friend or loved one’s recovery, the last thing they need is celebration that suggests the fight is over; all is good.</p>

<p>That’s because the fight is not in the least bit over. If anything, some say the fight for sobriety lasts a lifetime. So other than a successful break from alcohol or any other drug your loved one may have achieved, now is the time to leave them alone to figure out their own approach to being sober.</p>

<p>What you don’t want to be is too overbearing or enthusiastic. Try not to give your loved one pretentious hope that all is good. Only they will know from going out (or staying at home), in which that person could be exposed to multitude of triggers, how close they are to a recovery strong enough to withstand friends and their proclivities.</p>

<a id="a-calm-cool-and-slow-approach" class="anchor" href="#a-calm-cool-and-slow-approach" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A CALM, COOL AND SLOW APPROACH</h2>

<p>It’s not as if you have to tiptoe and lower your voice to a whisper each time you see your recovering loved one. However, there are some restraints on your part that you should be aware of:</p>

<p>1)  Your friend is not an invalid, especially after having come this far with their recovery. There is, however, a long way to go. Don’t hover over, or become overly exuberant. This could set up your friend for failure. Let them embark and complete their own tasks. Doing so will give them reassurance that can carry over into their next responsibility.</p>

<p>2)  Don’t rush, be reassuring. Sobriety can’t be rushed as is. It’s a day-by-day venture which needs a fair amount of nurturing and patience.</p>

<p>Which is the clear message. Sobriety is like a fragile flower or a tentative agreement. Until strength is grown into either one, they will always be at risk.</p>

<p>In short, sobriety needs its space too.</p>
